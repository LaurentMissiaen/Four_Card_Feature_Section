## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Four_Card_Feature_Section](https://laurentmissiaen.github.io/Four_Card_Feature_Section/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first CSS Grid project, I found some good resources online and succeeded! I tried not to declare too many specifics, so the grid could "work for me", I'm starting to understand this concept more and more. Don't get extremely specific when you don't have to, your design will flow better and your code will by clearer.

### Continued development

I want to get better and more fluid with setting up grids and face projects where I will have to debate if Grid of Flexbox is the better route.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - Kevin is the man! Very clear explanation and follow along video.
